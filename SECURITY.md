## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any security related vulnerability in the [advisories section at GitHub](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/security/advisories) or via email to info@keleo.de or kpapst@gmx.net.

I will work as fast as I can to fix the problem and publish a bugfix release / security update. 
Depending on the size of the required fixes, this might take a couple of hours or a couple of days.

You can expect that your message will be answered ASAP, but please take into account that I am living in the timezone Europe/Berlin. 

If your issue is valid and after I verified and fixed it, you will be mentioned in the release notes. 
I am grateful for any (discrete) disclosure of vulnerabilities!
